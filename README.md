Today, I studied several fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP. Here is a summary of what I have learned:

## 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects to structure code. Objects encapsulate data and the methods that operate on that data.

## 2. The Class and The Object

Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods. Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data.

## 3. The Setters And The Getters

 These are the methods used in Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) which helps to access the private attributes from a class. Setters: These are the methods used in OOPS feature which helps to set the value to private attributes in a class.

## 4. Access Modifiers 

Public , Private , Protected
Access modifiers (or access specifiers) are keywords in object-oriented languages that set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members.

## 5. Construct 

A constructor method is a special function that creates an instance of the class. Typically, constructor methods accept input arguments to assign the data stored in properties and return an initialized object.

## 6. Encapsulation

Encapsulation involves grouping the data (attributes) and methods that operate on this data within a class, thereby restricting direct access to the attributes from outside the class.


## 7. Inheritance

In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
